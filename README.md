# GoodBlox-Legacy-Launcher
legacy launcher for goodblox designed to work on windows 2000 minimum

these are used on the goodblox legacy installer

written in visual c# 2005 on a windows 2000 virtual machine and yes it does indeed work 

(natively on winxp but for win2k you need to install some rollups and kernel extensions)

requires .net 2.0
